// Birthday Cake Candles = https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/birthday-cake-candles/problem

// You are in charge of the cake for your niece's birthday and have decided the
// cake will have one candle for each year of her total age. When she blows out
// the candles, sheâ€™ll only be able to blow out the tallest ones. Your task is
// to find out how many candles she can successfully blow out.

// For example, if your niece is turning 4 years old, and the cake will have 4
// candles of height 4, 4, 1, 3, she will be able to blow out 2 candles
// successfully, since the tallest candles are of height 4 and there are 2 such
// candles.
